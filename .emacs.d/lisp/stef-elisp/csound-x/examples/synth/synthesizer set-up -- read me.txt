example set-up for a CSD-based MIDI synthesizer
===============================================

(WARNING: the scripts provided here are for Windows; and you will need Keykit)

1) put the files csound-csd-synth.el, csound-csd-synth.bat and bamboo.bat in the same folder, preferably in your Path. 

2) in csound-csd-synth.el, write your own settings (directories and options), then put bamboo-synth.csd correspondingly, in SYNTHS-dir

that's it. 
now the command:
        
        bamboo music.wav music.mid

will compile an audio file "music.wav" (in SFDIR) from the MIDI file "music.mid" (supposed to live in MIDI-dir since no path is specified).

note that the arguments may appear in any order. the extensions ".wav" and ".mid" are required, though.
