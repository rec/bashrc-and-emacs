;;; Commentary:

;; Duplicator is a small package that help you duplicate lines.
;;
;; 1. Duplicate current line if no region is active
;; 2. Duplicate all lines in the region if region is active
;; 3. Support prefix argument to execute multiple times
;; 4. Never pollute kill ring

;; ## Usage:
;;
;; (require 'duplicator)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") 'duplicator/duplicate-lines)

;; ## Limitations:
;; enable transient-mark-mode is required
